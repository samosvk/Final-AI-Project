# Final-AI-Project

## Intro
We create and investigate the effectiveness of a predictive model that predicts, given a certain class of credit-card transaction with 28 attributes, whether a transaction is or is not fraudulent.

## How to run the project
The project is a self-contained Jupyter Notebook that can be run on any computer or in Google Colabs. The total runtime for all the cells together is 1 hour. The classifiers take 20 minutes to run altogether, and the PCA analysis runs for about  32 minutes.
