# Final-AI-Project

## Intro
We create and investigate the effectiveness of a predictive model that predicts, given a certain class of credit-card transaction with 28 attributes, whether a transaction is or is not fraudulent.

## How to get the data?

Unfortunately, the data is too big to directly upload to GitHub. Hence, it is hosted on Google Drive and can be found in the Final Project assignment Directory, in the Submissions Folder.
A link to the csv file can be found here: [Download Link](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1yxnySp8OrOvARAqvjwtM5wawpF5aSm-_)

## How to run the project
The project is a self-contained Jupyter Notebook that can be run on any computer or in Google Colabs. The total runtime for all the cells together is 1 hour. The classifiers take 20 minutes to run altogether, and the PCA analysis runs for about  32 minutes.
